# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions and providers.
# To use it, "pip install tox" and then run "tox" from this directory.
# You will have to set all required environment variables (below) before
# running the tests.
#
# Alternatively, to run mock tests only, run tox as follows:
# CB_USE_MOCK_PROVIDERS=True tox -e py27-aws
#
# Simply running tox -e py27-aws also works, because the default is to use
# mock providers.
